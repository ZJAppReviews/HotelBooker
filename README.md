# Hotel iOS Application
The Hotel iOS App is an application that shows Hotel shopping and booking. It provides a settings panel that allows you to switch between sending requests to the Travelport Pre-Production or Production systems.  

<b>Purpose</b>
<p>The App is a proof-of-concept that Travelport created to show how we may make Universal API available via JSON messages. The code showcases using Universal API in a mobile environment with JSON messages over XML and can be downloaded to interactively see our JSON and Universal API design. The application can be viewed using a simulator, such as Xcode. Online help can be found at: https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/JSON/Content/Overview.htm
<p><i>The App is intended for testing purposes. If you want to use the code in a live application, please contact your Travelport Support representative.</i>

<b>Legal</b>
<p>This application is designed to provide a representation of some of the Travelport Universal API hotel functionality for developers who are coding to and wish to familiarize themselves with Travelport Universal API. This application provides access to the Travelport Copy and Production Systems via a config file. Travelport requires you to use YOUR OWN Universal API credentials to access either or both the Copy and Production Systems.  Credentials sent using the POC are sent in clear text and Travelport provides no SSL certificate for use of the POC.  Usage of the application is at the developerâ€™s risk, and Travelport disclaims any and all liabilities arising from such usage.
