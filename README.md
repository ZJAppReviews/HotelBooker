# Hotel iOS Application
The Hotel iOS App is an application that shows Hotel shopping and booking and allows you to:
<ul>
<li>Search for hotels based on a city location using lat/long.</li>
<li>Sort search results by price/distance and star ratings.</li>
<li>View images of hotel properties.</li>
<li>See detailed rates associated with hotel properties.</li>
<li>See which amenities a property offers.</li>
<li>Make a hotel reservation (Pre-production only).</li>
<li>Switch between sending requests to the Pre-Production and Production systems.</li> 
</ul>

<b>Purpose</b>
<p>The App is a proof-of-concept that Travelport created to showcase using Universal API in a mobile environment with JSON messages over XML. It can be downloaded and viewed using a simulator, such as Xcode. Online help can be found at: https://support.travelport.com/webhelp/JSON/Content/Overview.htm
<p><i>The App and the JSON API are intended for testing purposes. The code is provided on an as-is basis, without guarantees. You are free to use the code as the basis for your own application. If you want to use the code in a live application, please contact your Travelport Sales representative.</i>

<b>Legal</b>
<p>This application is designed to provide a representation of some of the Travelport Universal API hotel functionality for developers who are coding to and wish to familiarize themselves with Travelport Universal API. This application provides access to the Travelport Copy and Production Systems via a config file. Travelport requires you to use YOUR OWN Universal API credentials to access either or both the Copy and Production Systems.  Credentials sent using the POC are sent in clear text and Travelport provides no SSL certificate for use of the POC.  Usage of the application is at the developerâ€™s risk, and Travelport disclaims any and all liabilities arising from such usage.
